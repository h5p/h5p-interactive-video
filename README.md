## Contributing

Translators, make sure to read through the [tips for language contributors](https://h5p.org/contributing). A good approach is to check that the updated language file matches the structure of the [norwegian translation](language/nn.json).  

Developers, take a look at the [developer guide](https://h5p.org/developers) which has information on [coding guidelines](https://h5p.org/code-style), [api-references](https://h5p.org/documentation/api/H5P.html) and much more. Before submitting pull-requests, please consider [testing your code thoroughly](testplan.md) to speed up the review process.
